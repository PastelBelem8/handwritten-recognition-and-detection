# Handwritten Recognition and Detection 

This repository contains the resources used during the development of an 
ML system for handwritting recognition and detection. 


This project is to be integrated in the architectural field, hence it 
will have a strong bias towards the [state-of-the-art](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rHiDOpCiE8bEnyy9o4EmpVaEuURKVca-OpuCxVQ1TWs/edit?usp=sharing) literature both in 
Architecture and computer vision. 


**Note**: This repository is a work in progress. 


## Requirements of the System 

- Capable of detecting handwritten components in an image
- Capable of recognizing handwritten components, namely, mathematical symbols, 
words, greek letters, among others.
